          <p class="testimonial">
            Until march 2020, I was preparing for software roles but could
            neither get an internship nor was I able to crack any test for SDE.
            I got an internship in JSW on an analytics based project and then I
            decided to get into analytics based companies. I was totally
            clueless about the resume and the right way for preparation ahead.
            Aryan bhaiya curated a time-based study plan to ace placement and
            recommended some must-do courses and projects to have a strong
            resume. Under his guidance, I was able to work on my aptitude and
            managed to crack my tests. He constantly helped me till the end and
            made me well-prepared for GDs and interviews. So I recommend you all
            to join the programme organised by aryan bhaiya and MAS team.

            Getting placed in a reputed firm like MasterCard is defintely the
            headstart a graduate can aspire for, but the road wasn't as easy as
            it seems, thanks to the pandemic and lockdown. Mentorship from
            seniors like Sajan bhaiya proved to be of great help. The structured
            roadmap, custom curated resources, effective tracking, personalized
            sessions and mocks not only enhanced my preparation but also
            bolstered my confidence. As I feel that getting the right mentorship
            is the key to getting sucessfully placed , I would recommend juniors
            preparing for Analytics and data role to get themselves enrolled in
            the mentorship programme offered by MySchoolAnalytics.

            Aryan bhaiya, one of the most down-to-earth seniors I have ever met,
            eased out my journey to getting placed on day 1 especially during
            these tough times. I was not sure about the placement process, he
            was the one who solved all my doubts and helped me in writing an
            effective resume that would convey my capabilities to the employers.
            He was always ready to help be it mock case studies, interviews or
            any other step. I would whole-heartedly recommend My Analytics
            School to the juniors, especially those who are looking for
            Data/product analyst roles.

            motivation required in tough times, they guided me very well like a

            when I was preparing for my placements. I am going to work as a
            Graduate Analyst at Deutsche bank this summer. Being a student of
            chemical engineering, it was tough to convince companies that you
            can excel in a non-core job and that's where the My Analytics Team's
            assistance turned out to be my savior. I am grateful to my seniors

            mock interviews. All those sessions with mentors helped a lot in
            enhancing my skills and confidence. I would definitely recommend My

            off. During placement having an experienced guide who has gone
            through the same journey is really important besides having ample

            "The must-have requisite for placement is not your skills, but your
            plan" thus said Aryan bhaiya while laying out the most optimal
            timeline for a well-planned placement preparation, his most crucial
            lesson which was going to be used a lot in the coming 8 months.
            Whenever I needed someone to confide in, he was just a call away.
            Right from exclusive analytics tips to company level inside info, he
            proved to be of great help. At times when I used to lose
            self-confidence, his brotherly scoldings were elixir enough to help
            me grab 2 offers on day 1. I'll recommend My school analytics to
            all. It's worth a try, definitely.
